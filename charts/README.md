### 🎯 Why It Matters

This visualization supports the project’s goal to:

- Quantify **compliance risk over time** in the retail convenience sector
- Identify **peak enforcement periods**
- Enable strategic questions like:  
  > “How does compliance pressure align with product profitability, geographic expansion, or operational risk?”

This is foundational for merging OSHA inspection data with **product sales**, **store performance**, and **risk management frameworks**.
